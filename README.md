#Summary of PyCitySchools

There are 15 schools
The total number of students: 39,170
The Total of the budget for the school in the district:  $24,649,428.00
The average reading score:  81.88 %
The average math score:  78.99 %
The percentage of students who passed reading: 85.81 %
The percentage of students who passed math: 74.98 %
The percentage of students that passed math and reading: 65.17%

##Analysis and comparisons of the data:

We can observe that out of the 15 schools, 53.33% are private schools and 46.66% are public schools. Based on the type of school, it can be observed that 90.43% of students in private schools passed math and reading. While only 53.67% of students in public schools passed math and reading, as first analysis we can conclude that private schools have better scores, and more students pass and understand math and reading better.
Based on the type of number of students that each school has, I observed that if a school has more students, between (2000-5000 students), the percentage of students passing in math and reading is only 58.28%. While if a school has less than 2000 students the percentage of students passing both math and reading subjects increases significantly to 90.61%.
The following analysis is based on the budget per student. We can see that if $585 or less is budgeted per student, 90% of the students can have good grades and pass in math and reading. While if a larger budget is allocated ($645-680) there are fewer students who pass math and reading.
In this analysis based on the money allocated to each student we can see that if an average of $585 is spent per student, they can have a good education, but the factors that greatly influence this are the number of students and whether it is a private or public school, which is key to better understand budget management and the best allocation of it.
Another observation from the results of this analysis is that the top 5 highest performing schools are private schools with 90% of their studentâ€™s passing math and Reading, and the lowest performing schools are public schools with approximately only 50% of students passing math and Reading.

In conclusion, out of the 15 schools in the district with a total of 39,170 students, only 74.98% of the students passed math and 85.80% passed Reading. Thus, only 65.17% of the students passed both math and reading.

##Suggestions for better projections:

Collecting data on administrative expenditure habits in order to see if that has any correlation to test scores.
The teacher to student ratios would be good to know as well, as its widely believed that the more teachers per student helps in the education process.
Location of the school, to see what type of neighborhood the schools are in, like lower-, middle- or upper-class neighborhoods
